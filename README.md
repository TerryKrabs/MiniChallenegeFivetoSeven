Mini Challenege 5-7 - EndPoints
Summary : I Created 4 mini web Api's that were based off of the Mini Challenge's from the combine. This assignment was quite easy. The hardest part was creating the services all at once, so from now ill do the controller/Service together.
Peer Review - Bria Harrold - Xavier did a good job on the assignment! All the Api's function properly and there are no errors. The mad Lib prompt was pretty funny as well
